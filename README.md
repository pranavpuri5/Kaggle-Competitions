# Kaggle-Titanic
Did a lot of data-preprocessing and I only removed the name column as that contain a lot of strings which the ml model obviously cannot process. Rest were encoded using the pandas dummies method. I concated the test and training data here which helped me see the data as in one csv file.
Got a final prediction score of 98.2, yet the precision score was 67 percent. Any Ideas to make that better is highly Appreciated. Cheers!!
